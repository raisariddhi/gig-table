# GigTable.com - Problem Domain and Design Opportunities

This README.md document provides an overview of GigTable.com's problem domain and the major design opportunities identified within the platform.

## Problem Domain

GigTable.com serves a specific problem domain that revolves around musicians, promoters, and venue managers seeking to book gigs in the Madison, WI area. The current landscape involves these stakeholders resorting to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Discord, as well as email communications, to facilitate local music acts. Musicians often face the challenge of securing venues either through direct outreach or personal connections to venue staff, event promoters, or venue owners/managers.

## Identified Problems

Several issues exist within the current ecosystem:

1. **Feature Overload**: Existing platforms intended for event planning offer a plethora of features, many of which remain unused, while crucial functionalities are missing.

2. **Social Media Platforms**: The user group relies on social media platforms primarily designed for casual communication, causing difficulties in picture options, message organization, and overall discoverability.

3. **Fragmented Experience**: Madison's local music scene is growing, but there is no comprehensive platform that caters to the needs of musicians, promoters, and venue staff for booking gigs.

## Design Opportunities

GigTable.com aims to address these issues and provide a unified solution. Several major design opportunities have been identified:

1. **Groups Feature**: Implementation of a groups' feature, enabling individual users to join bands or venue groups. These groups offer shared calendars, message groups, and to-do lists.

2. **Shared Calendars**: Users can create and invite both individual and group members to venue events. These events serve as a platform for organizing DIY gigs.

3. **To-Do Lists**: Within event contexts, group members can create to-do list tasks for streamlined organization of necessary steps in setting up gigs.

4. **Message Groups**: Messaging on GigTable.com offers enhanced organization compared to social media platforms. It includes filtering and search features to facilitate the easy retrieval of specific messages.

With these design opportunities, GigTable.com aims to create an all-encompassing platform that connects venues, promoters, and independent artists, fostering a more efficient and organized approach to booking events in Madison, WI.
