# GigTable.com - Problem Domain and Design Opportunities

This README.md document provides an overview of GigTable.com's problem domain and the major design opportunities identified within the platform.

## Problem Domain

GigTable.com serves a specific problem domain that revolves around musicians, promoters, and venue managers seeking to book gigs in the Madison, WI area. The current landscape involves these stakeholders resorting to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Discord, as well as email communications, to facilitate local music acts. Musicians often face the challenge of securing venues either through direct outreach or personal connections to venue staff, event promoters, or venue owners/managers.

## Identified Problems

Several issues exist within the current ecosystem:

1. **Feature Overload**: Existing platforms intended for event planning offer a plethora of features, many of which remain unused, while crucial functionalities are missing.

2. **Social Media Platforms**: The user group relies on social media platforms primarily designed for casual communication, causing difficulties in picture options, message organization, and overall discoverability.

3. **Fragmented Experience**: Madison's local music scene is growing, but there is no comprehensive platform that caters to the needs of musicians, promoters, and venue staff for booking gigs.

## Design Opportunities

GigTable.com aims to address these issues and provide a unified solution. Several major design opportunities have been identified:

1. **Groups Feature**: Implementation of a groups' feature, enabling individual users to join bands or venue groups. These groups offer shared calendars, message groups, and to-do lists.

2. **Shared Calendars**: Users can create and invite both individual and group members to venue events. These events serve as a platform for organizing DIY gigs.

3. **To-Do Lists**: Within event contexts, group members can create to-do list tasks for streamlined organization of necessary steps in setting up gigs.

4. **Message Groups**: Messaging on GigTable.com offers enhanced organization compared to social media platforms. It includes filtering and search features to facilitate the easy retrieval of specific messages.

With these design opportunities, GigTable.com aims to create an all-encompassing platform that connects venues, promoters, and independent artists, fostering a more efficient and organized approach to booking events in Madison, WI.

# GigTable.com - Contextual Inquiry and Model Analysis

## Contextual Inquiry

For GigTable.com, a contextual inquiry was performed involving three users to gain insights into their current methods for booking and performing gigs in the Madison and Wisconsin area using available technology and social media platforms. The interviews followed an expert-apprentice method, during which the users explained their processes, tasks, and interactions from gig booking to performance and beyond.

## Model Analysis

The inquiry yielded several stages of analysis and model creation:

### Transcription and Open Coding
- Each interview was transcribed.
- Transcriptions were open-coded to identify key themes and elements.

### User Communication
- Users demonstrated how they communicate with contacts while booking gigs.
- A significant amount of back-and-forth communication was observed.
- Users indicated maintaining personal calendars and chats across various social media platforms.

### Video Transcription
- Video recordings of interviews were transcribed.
- Information from transcriptions was coded.

### Affinity Diagrams (Again)
- Transcribed data was organized into affinity diagrams.
- Affinity diagrams helped form different models.
- Affinity diagrams for each user were designed to understand various aspects, including motivations, problems, tasks, physical aspects, and potential solutions.

![User 3 Affinity Diagram](figures/affinity-diagrams/Affinity3.png)

### Flow Models
- Flow models were created for artists, musicians, audiences, promoters, and venues.
- These models illustrated communication, expectations, and actions among these stakeholders.
- Issues such as repetitive iterations, clutter, and unused features were identified.

![User 2 Flow Model](figures/models/user-2-flow.png)
![User 3 Flow Model](figures/models/user-3-flow.png)

### Sequence Models
- Sequence models visually represented the gig planning process, from wanting to play a gig to promoting a planned gig.
- Obstacles and issues related to the usage of social media platforms were highlighted.

![User 3 Sequence Model](figures/models/user-3-sequence.png)

### Artifact Models
- Artifact models reconstructed the physical system users interacted with during gig planning.
- These models showcased the organization and possible problems of user platforms.

![User 2 Artifact Model](figures/models/user-2-artifact.png)
![User 3 Artifact Model](figures/models/user-3-artifact.png)

### Cultural Models
- Cultural models delved into emotional intents and motivations affecting the gig booking process.
- These models correlated color-coded intents with user interactions.

![User 2 Culture Model](figures/models/user-2-culture.png)
![User 3 Culture Model](figures/models/user-3-culture.png)

### Physical Models
- Physical models depicted the layout of gig venues and the transfer of messages during the communication process.
- The physical environment in which users finalized gigs was understood.

![User 2 Physical Model](figures/models/user-2-physical.png)
![User 3 Physical Model](figures/models/user-3-physical.png)

## Conclusion

These models were developed to gain a comprehensive understanding of how users currently book gigs using existing technology. They encompass tasks, artifacts, intentions, and breakdowns to inform the development of an interface that resolves their current pain points.
