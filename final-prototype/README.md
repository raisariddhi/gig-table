# GigTable.com - Calendar, Messaging, and To-Do Features

## Calendar Feature

After receiving valuable feedback from prototype testing, several new features and visual aids have been integrated into GigTable's calendar:

### Notification System
- A red dot indicator has been added to the calendar to notify users of upcoming events or new notifications.
- This enhancement reduces cognitive load by providing users with immediate event-related information.

### Stage Diagram
- Venue locations now feature a stage diagram, providing bands with insight into equipment placement on the stage.
- This addition was inspired by User 2's input and benefits events that require musicians to provide a stage plot.
- Stage plots can now be shared with all event participants within GigTable.

### Final Prototype
- The final calendar prototype was designed using Figma, including interactive components for different pages and input information saving to create events.

## Messaging Feature

The messaging system's final prototype in Figma incorporates important adjustments based on user testing:

### Landing Page
- The landing page displays recent message previews and provides search and filter options for users.
- Users can efficiently locate specific group chats from a central location.

### Message Filtering
- Users can filter messages based on their preferences, including the type of performance discussed in a specific group chat (e.g., solo, duet, etc.).
- Filters also allow users to sort group chats based on upcoming or past events.

### User Feedback
- Issues identified during user testing, such as difficulties finding the "go back" option while using filters, have been addressed.
- Date filtering has been refined, allowing users to specify date ranges for precise searches.

### Final Prototype Screenshot
- Below is a screenshot of the final messaging prototype with the implemented changes:

## To-Do Feature

A subtle yet impactful adjustment has been made to the To-Do feature:

### "Add Task" Button
- The "checkbox" icon within the "Add Task" button has been removed, simplifying the button's appearance.
- This change reduces potential user confusion and aligns with user feedback, particularly from User 1.

## Landing Page Update

To address confusion regarding event requests and invitations, the landing page has been updated:

### "Invitations" Section
- A new "Invitations" section has been added to the landing page, which can be expanded or collapsed using an arrow indicator.
- Notifications, such as the count of pending invitations and unread notifications (indicated by a red dot), are prominently displayed.
- Clicking on messages takes users directly to event invitations, streamlining the process of accessing and responding to requests.
